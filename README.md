# AI-Generated-Essay-Detection
# Overview
This project aims to detect AI-generated essays with high accuracy using a combination of techniques including Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), Transformer model, TF-IDF, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. With a focus on maintaining simplicity and efficiency, the model achieves an impressive 98% accuracy.
# Features
- BPE Tokenization: Utilizes Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for efficient tokenization of text data.
- Transformer Model: Leverages a pre-trained Transformer model for contextual understanding of text.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Implements TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier: Trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for essay classification.
- Flask Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Flask for easy interaction with the detection system.
# Requirements
